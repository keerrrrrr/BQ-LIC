Bayesian Quantile Regression Model with Linear Inequality Constraints

This code is designed to solve Bayesian quantile regression model with linear inequality constraints. Leveraging asymmetric Laplace distributions, we propose two novel Gibbs sampling methods based on truncated normal and truncated Laplace prior distributions, respectively.
